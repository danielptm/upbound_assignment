## About this project
###
This is the beginning of a node seed project for DD&D which is the skeleton of a full blown backend that can be easy for newcomers
to get started with and can scale easily for simple or complex applications.

Please create issues that you would like to have in a base skeleton project. You can just create the issues, or you can create and build them. :)

### Testing suggestion
Only write tests for the service layer, and dont include any logic at the api level.
That makes it easy to have high test coverage and not have to worry about what should I test?
